this platform.

## Rights of people

All people using this software should expect to have the right to:

- Self control over their data, including the ability to alter or delete at any time.
- Free from harmful discrimination of any kind
- Informed consent over control and privacy of their data, including access and understand data held and shared on their
  behalf
- To be able to use and access this software regardless of ability, culture or language.

## Questions?

Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/kanidm/kanidm/issues/new/choose) with the project - we want to know if we
have missed anything or can improve what we are doing.
