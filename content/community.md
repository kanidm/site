## The Project

Kanidm was created in 2018 by William Brown (Firstyear). Since then the community has grown with
[contributions from more than 40 individuals](https://github.com/kanidm/kanidm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md) and has
mentored multiple times for Google Summer of Code. The work of everyone of these persons has made Kanidm the success
that it is today.

### Project Lead / Author

William is a Senior Software Engineer at SUSE Labs, Australia. His work at SUSE has enabled him to continue to invest in
Kanidm and related identity and security technologies such as Webauthn, TPMs, LDAP, and OpenID/OAuth2.
